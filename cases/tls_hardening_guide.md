# AppSec Guide: Disabling Legacy TLS Versions and Weak Cipher Suites

## 1. Objective

This document describes a **generic approach to hardening TLS configurations** and disabling weak cipher suites in enterprise application environments.  
The goal is to ensure **secure data transmission**, maintain compliance with internal security baselines and external frameworks (such as PCI DSS), and minimize operational risk during remediation.

---

## 2. Typical Environment

The described approach applies to **multi-tier enterprise systems** where several internal applications may share the same servers (DB, Application, or IIS).  
Such environments often include:
- Internal web applications and thick-client systems  
- Multiple applications sharing the same infrastructure  
- Strict change management and testing requirements  
- Separate UAT, PROD, and DR/COB environments

---

## 3. Remediation Workflow

### **1. Inventory and Assessment**
- Identify all affected systems and environments (UAT, PROD, DR).  
- Review current TLS and cipher configurations.  
- Confirm which components are in scope (servers, load balancers, middleware).  
- Document dependencies, including upstream/downstream connections and integrations.

### **2. Risk Evaluation**
- Determine exposure level (internal/external).  
- Review audit or vulnerability findings and corresponding CVSS ratings. Sometimes, this means internal Risk Rating not a CVSS score.  
- Set remediation priorities based on business criticality and system impact.  
- Define acceptable remediation window.

### **3. Planning and Coordination**
- Coordinate with InfoSec, system owners, and infrastructure teams.  
- Prepare rollback and contingency plans.  
- Schedule maintenance windows to avoid conflicts with other releases.  
- Obtain CAB approval for production changes.

### **4. Implementation**
- Disable legacy TLS versions (1.0/1.1) and weak cipher suites in test/UAT.  
- Conduct functional and integration regression testing.  
- Validate connectivity and encryption handshake results (e.g., via OpenSSL or Qualys).  
- Proceed to production deployment once testing is signed off.  

### **5. Validation and Monitoring**
- Confirm post-deployment stability and application connectivity.  
- Collect logs to verify no handshake or configuration errors.  
- Keep change records and validation evidence for audit trail.  
- Update DR/COB procedures to include verification of upstream service availability after similar changes.

## 4. Lessons Learned and Best Practices

- **Early coordination** between App, Infra, and InfoSec teams reduces rework.  
- **CMDB data may be incomplete** — verify real dependencies through testing and traffic tracing.  
- Always test against **matching OS and library versions** between UAT and PROD.  
- Integrate TLS validation into **regular hardening and compliance reviews**.
